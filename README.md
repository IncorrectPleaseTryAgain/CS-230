# Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
My client was The Gaming Room, they wanted me to develop a web-based game. It was required that the game, “Draw It or Lose It”, would be able to serve multiple platforms; they already had the game available in the Android app store.  As a frame of reference, the game is loosely similar to the 1980s television game Win, Lose or Draw. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Win,_Lose_or_Draw

The design constraint:

- The game needs to have the ability to have one or more teams involved, because the game cannot be played with a single team.

- Each team needs to be able to have multiple players assigned to it.

- Game and team names must be unique to allow users to check whether a name is in use when choosing a team name.

- Only one instance of the game can exist in memory at any given time.

- The game should be a web-based application that can be accessed by multiple platforms, such as Mac, Linux, Windows and Mobile Devices.

# What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
I providing the details necessary to showcase the development requirements for the server-side, client-side, and development tools which will be necessary in a Mac, Linux, Windows, and mobile device environment. Analyzing the UML diagram and providing a clear andd concise description of the software structure was done faily well. 

# What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

# If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

# How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

# How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
